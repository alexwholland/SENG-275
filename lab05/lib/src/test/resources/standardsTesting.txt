Which standards tool did you use?

Google Lighthouse with a Chrome Browser.



Name any ONE TEST that passed, and describe why that test is important, in your own words.
What would be the problem if the test had failed?

Test that passed according to Google Lighthouse: Uses HTTPS

Google Lighthouse checked this test to ensure that the SENG 275 Brightspace
main page is protected with HTTPS. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an
internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and security of data between
the user's computer and Brightspace. Every website that collects and saves info such as passwords and
personal information is required by Google to get HTTPS. If this test had failed there may be a security
risk to the students and staff using the SENG 275 Brightspace page, in addition to any legal troubles
from Google.



Name any ONE TEST that failed (yellow or red) and explain why the failed test suggest
there's a problem with the website.  Who is it a problem for?  What kinds of obstacles
could this issue present?

Test that failed according to Google Lighthouse:
Trust and Safety - Includes front-end JavaScript libraries with known security vulnerabilities

Google Lighthouse identified that some third-party scripts contain known security vulnerabilities that could
be exploited by attackers. This is an issue for the front-end developers of Brightspace as they are
utilizing these front-end libraries. However, the developers of these libraries should be prompted to fix them.
Potential issues are (as suggested by Lighthouse) exploitation of the vulnerabilities by attackers.
If the developers of these third-party libraries were unwilling to fix the issue, obstacles presented to the
Brighspace devs would likely be to find a new libraries or live with the potential risks.
