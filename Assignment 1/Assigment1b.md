**Q1)** Consider a program for the determination of the largest amongst three numbers. Its
input is a triple of positive integers (say x, y and z) and values of eachx, y and z are from
interval [1, 300]. Design test cases according to Equivalence class: (4M)
Generate any 16 equivalence classes for valid and invalid combination of x, y and z. Eg.

I<sub>1</sub> = { 1 ≤ x ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ z ≤ 300 } (All inputs are valid)
